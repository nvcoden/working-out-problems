'''
Steve has a string of lowercase characters in range ascii[["a".."z"]]. 
He wants to reduce the string to its shortest length by doing a series of operations. 
In each operation, he selects a pair of adjacent lowercase letters that match, and he deletes them. 
For instance, the string aab could be shortened to b in one operation.

Steveâ€™s task is to delete as many characters as possible using this method and print the resulting string. 
If the final string is empty, return Empty String.
